# Merge_Cambridge_books
A script for merging the splitted pdf files of Cambridge E-book in Mac OS.

When you download some academic e-books from the [Cambridge Core website](https://www.cambridge.org/core/). The website only provides the archived zip which contains the splitted pdf of every chapter and no cover image.

This script help you create a single pdf file with cover.

## Requirement: 
Automator, img2pdf(pip install with python)

## Usage:
* Please save the cover image with the same name as zip file from the cambridge website or somewhere else, and convert other format e.g, to jpg first.
* Put all the jpg, zip and this script in the same folder.
* In the terminal, just `./merge_cambridge.sh`

## Issue:
Not work in linux, will be a updated version later.
